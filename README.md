| :mega: Calling for Maintainers |
|--------------|
| With the introduction of [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core), I've now shifted my focus to the Core-specific project - [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore). That will be receiving most of my (already limited) personal time, and so I won't have the capacity to maintain this one at a sufficient rate. Still, I'd love to see it live on and am seeking one or two "core" contributors / maintainers to help out. Ideally, these would be people who have already contributed through PRs and understand the inner workings and overall design. Once signed-up, we can agree on an approach that works - ultimately, I want to remove myself as the bottleneck to merging PRs and getting fresh Nugets published. If you're interested, please let me know by adding a comment [here](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/1053) |

Swashbuckle
=========

Seamlessly adds a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui to provide a rich discovery, documentation and playground experience to your API consumers.

In addition to its Swagger generator, Swashbuckle also contains an embedded version of [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) which it will automatically serve up once Swashbuckle is installed. This means you can complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their integration efforts. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance, allowing you to focus on building an awesome API!

And that's not all ...

Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more details.

**Swashbuckle Core Features:**

* Auto-generated [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
* Seamless integration of swagger-ui
* Reflection-based Schema generation for describing API types
* Extensibility hooks for customizing the generated Swagger doc
* Extensibility hooks for customizing the swagger-ui
* Out-of-the-box support for leveraging Xml comments
* Support for describing ApiKey, Basic Auth and OAuth2 schemes ... including UI support for the Implicit OAuth2 flow

**Swashbuckle 5.0**

Swashbuckle 5.0 makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0 schema is significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and, as a result, the Swashbuckle config interface has undergone yet another overhaul. Checkout the [transition guide](#transitioning-to-swashbuckle-50) if you're upgrading from a prior version.
